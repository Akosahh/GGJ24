GAMEPLAY LOOP

infect cities and people with laughter
aim to infect 100% of world population
travel around using planes and ferries
people are only infected for set amount of time (e.g. 30 seconds)
cities are infected for longer periods of time (e.g. 2 minutes)
when people lose infection, they become angry and can't be infected
people can infect other people with anger temporarily (e.g. 10 seconds)
if angry citizen collides with player, 5 second stun?
information window to show infection status of cities and percentage of population
healthy people run away from angry people? angry people chase down healthy people?
emojis: angry, laughing, bored face. all need an alpha background
buildings as rectangles? need circle/rect collision detection

THINGS TO DO

setup collision detection to prevent entering the sea (Billy)
create citizen and city class to store position and state information about individual citizens and cities (Asher)
create airport/seaport classes to store information about flights and ships (Luke)
citizen state information needs to store current direction, length of time for movement left and ability to tick
wrap world map left to right, but not top to bottom. lock camera and allow character to move in screen space?
collision detection system for citizens/cities/player to check state and outcome (what happens if angry citizen collides with infected city?)
create ability for player to board a flight or a ship to travel, animate?

QUESTIONS

player physics based movement? momentum? can they change direction every frame?
